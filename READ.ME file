Function Description
The add_numbers function takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.

How to use
To use the add_numbers function, you need to import it into your python code. 
Here's an example:
from add_numbers import add_numbers

a = 10
b = 20

result = add_numbers(a, b)
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {result}")
In the example above, we import the add_numbers function from the add_numbers module and use it to add the numbers 10 and 20.
